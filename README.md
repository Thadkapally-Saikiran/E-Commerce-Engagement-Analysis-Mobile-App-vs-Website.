# Ecommerce-Customers
I completed a project that predicts the amount that is spent by a customer annually based on data that is available 
on the store or ecommerce.This project forked from "Benjamin Jones Linear Regression Project" in Kaggle. In this project, I analyzed the attributes and their correlation and statistical fluke,etc.  This project required a complete understanding of linear regression and some statistics concepts such as standard deviation, variance, and distributions.

The Technologies/Methods/Libraries used in this Project are "Pandas (Reading the Dataset), EDA (Analyzing the Data), Scipy (finding correlation score b/w variables), Seaborn/Matplotlib (Data Visualization), Scikit- 
learn (Linear Regression model & metric score)".

# Ecommerce-Customers
This project is to predicts the amount that is spent by a customer annually based on data that is available 
on the store or ecommerce.This project has been forked from "Benjamin Jones Linear Regression Project" in Kaggle. In this Iam going to analyse all the attributes and their correlation and statistical fluke,etc

This project needs a complete understanding of linear regression mathematically and some statistics like standard deviation,variance, and distributions.

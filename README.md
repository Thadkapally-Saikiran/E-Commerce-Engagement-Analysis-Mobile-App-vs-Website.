## Introduction
This project tackles an important question for an E-Commerce clothing company in Iowa. They offer both online and in-store style consultations, but they need to decide where to focus their resources. Should they put more effort into their mobile app or their website? The goal is to make sure customers are happy and buy more clothes, so the company wants to know which platform is better for customer engagement and sales.

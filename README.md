## Introduction
This project tackles an important question for an E-Commerce clothing company in Iowa. They offer both online and in-store style consultations, but they need to decide where to focus their resources. Should they put more effort into their mobile app or their website? The goal is to make sure customers are happy and buy more clothes, so the company wants to know which platform is better for customer engagement and sales.

## Problem statement
1. Analyze customer behavior and spending patterns:
   * The goal is to understand how various customer engagement metrics (time on app, website, session length, membership duration) influence their yearly spending on an e-commerce platform
3. Identify key drivers of customer spending:
   * By visualizing the correlations between engagement metrics and spending, you aim to pinpoint which factors have the strongest positive impact on customer spending
4. Optimize customer engagement strategies:
   * The insights from the data analysis can be used to develop strategies that encourage customer retention (lengthening memberships) and increase app engagement to drive higher spending.
 
## Skills/ concepts demonstrated

The following Python vs Machine Learning features were incorporated:
- Importing the required libraries i.e. Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- Reading the dataset using "Pandas"
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Understanding and Cleaning the Data
- Statistical Correlation Analysis
- Visualizing Data using Seaborn library
- Draw Insights from visual Data and conclude data driven decision upon problem-statement
- Machine Learning Model Building
   * Separating the dataset into features and target data
   * Split the data set into train and test
   * Implementing the Linear Regression Model
   * Evaluating the prediction scores.
   * Visualizing the results
   * Repeat this for remaining Models(Decision Trees, RandomForest, K-NearestNeighbour, XGBoost, Adaboost)
- Evaluating the model accuracy.
- Compare the Models Evaluation Scores, Metrics and select the best Model performence
